# Act-Windows
Activate all copies of Windows and Microsoft Office in just a minute!

## Activation instructions :

- Copy all contents of the Act-WinOffice file to any memo or TXT file.
- Save the file with any name "example.bat" and save it in 'Bat' format.
- Make sure to disable Microsoft Protection so that it does not block all activations.
- Run the file you created "example.bat", in (administrator mode) necessary or it will not work.
